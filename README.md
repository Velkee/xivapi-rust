# xivapi-rust

xivapi-rust is a Rust library that provides a convenient way to interact with xivapi.com, a REST API for the game Final Fantasy XIV.

This library aims to be a starting point for other apps that wish to query xivapi.com, providing prebuilt functions and structs for querying and parsing information.
